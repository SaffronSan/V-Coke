Coca-Cola was created in 1886 by Dr. John S. Pemberton, a pharmacist in Atlanta, Georgia. Initially formulated as a medicinal tonic, the beverage was sold at Jacobs' Pharmacy, where it was marketed as a remedy for ailments such as indigestion and fatigue. The original formula combined coca leaf extract and kola nuts, giving the drink its distinctive flavor and its name. Pemberton’s bookkeeper, Frank M. Robinson, designed the now-famous cursive logo, which became an integral part of Coca-Cola’s brand identity. The early days of Coca-Cola saw it being sold at soda fountains as a refreshing, energizing tonic, and its unique taste quickly gained popularity among local consumers. Despite its medicinal beginnings, the brand’s emphasis shifted towards marketing it as a delightful soft drink, setting the stage for its future growth.

The initial success of Coca-Cola was modest but promising, thanks to its appealing taste and clever marketing. Pemberton’s partner and businessman, Asa Candler, recognized the product’s potential and acquired the rights to sell Coca-Cola in 1888. Candler’s aggressive marketing strategies, including distributing free samples and placing advertisements in newspapers, helped Coca-Cola become a household name in Atlanta. By the late 1890s, the brand’s popularity was soaring, and Candler’s efforts laid the groundwork for Coca-Cola’s expansion beyond Georgia. The early years of Coca-Cola marked the beginning of a beverage empire that would eventually become one of the most recognizable brands worldwide.
