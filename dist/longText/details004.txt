One of the most iconic moments in Coca-Cola’s advertising history occurred in 1931, with the introduction of the modern image of Santa Claus. Prior to this campaign, Santa’s appearance varied greatly across different regions and artists’ interpretations. Coca-Cola commissioned artist Haddon Sundblom to create a series of advertisements featuring a jolly, red-suited Santa Claus enjoying a bottle of Coca-Cola. Sundblom’s warm, friendly depiction of Santa resonated deeply with the public, and the images became synonymous with the holiday season.

This advertising campaign was instrumental in shaping the cultural image of Santa Claus as the cheerful, plump, bearded man in a red suit. Coca-Cola’s Santa became a symbol of joy, generosity, and holiday cheer, helping to boost sales during the Christmas season. The campaign’s success also demonstrated Coca-Cola’s ability to leverage storytelling and imagery to connect emotionally with consumers. Over the years, this portrayal of Santa Claus has persisted and become ingrained in popular culture, reinforcing Coca-Cola’s role in holiday festivities worldwide.

The Santa Claus campaign was more than just an advertisement—it was a strategic move that cemented Coca-Cola’s association with Christmas, a connection that endures to this day. It also exemplified Coca-Cola’s innovative approach to marketing, using art and storytelling to create a memorable brand identity. The campaign’s lasting impact showcased Coca-Cola’s mastery of brand positioning and emotional advertising, helping the company sustain its popularity through generations.
